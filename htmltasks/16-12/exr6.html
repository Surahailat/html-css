        <p style="font-size: 30px;">by the light of one of the three lanterns, which lighted, or rather ought to have lighted, the whole length of the street, he perceived one of those immense coalheavers, with a face the color of soot, so well stereotyped by Greuze, who was resting against one of the posts of the Hotel de la RocheGuyon, on which he had hung his bag. For an instant he appeared to hesitate to approach this man; but the coalheaver having sung the same air and the same burden, he appeared to lose all hesitation, and went straight to him.

            "Well, captain," said the man in the cloak, "did you see them?"
            
            "As plainly as I see you, colonel — a musketeer and two light horse; but I could not recognize them. However, as the musketeer hid his face in his handkerchief, 1 presume it was the regent. ' '
            
            "Himself; and the two light horse are -Simiane and -Ravanne. ' '
            
            "Ah, ah! my scholar," said the captain; "I shall have great pleasure in seeing him again: he is a good boy."
            
            "At any rate, captain, take care he does not recognize you."
            
            ' ' Recognize me ! It must be the devil himself to recognize me, accoutred as I am. It is you, rather, chevalier, who should take the caution. You have an unfortunately aristocratic air, which does not suit at all with your dress. However, there they are in the trap, and we must take care they do not leave it. Have our people been told ?"
            
            "Your people, captain. I know no more of them than they do of me. I quitted the group singing the burden which was our signal. Did they hear me ? Did they understand me ? I know nothing of it. "
            
            ' ' Be easy, colonel. These fellows hear half a voice, and understand half a word. ' '
            
            Indeed, as soon as the man in the cloak had left the group, a strange fluctuation which he had not foreseen began to take place in the crowd, which appeared to be composed only of passers-by, so that the song was not finished, nor the collection received. The crowd dispersed. A great many men left the circle, singly, or two and two, turning toward each other with an imperceptible gesture of the hand, some by the Kue de Yalois, some by the Cour des Fontaines, some by the Palais Eoyal itself, thus surrounding the Kue des Bons Enfants, which seemed to be the centre of the rendezvous. In consequence of this manoeuvre, the intention of which it is easy to understand, there only remained before the singer ten or twelve women, some children, and a good bourgeois of about forty years old, who, seeing that the collection was about to begin again, quitted his place with an air of profound contempt for all these new songs, and humming an old pastoral which he placed infinitely above them. It seemed to him that several men as he passed them made him signs; but as he did not belong to any secret society or any masonic lodge, he went on, singing his favorite,

            Then let me go, And let me play Beneath the hazel-tree,
            
            and after having followed the Eue St. Honore to the Barriere des Deux Sergents, turned the corner and disappeared. Almost at the same moment, the man in the cloak, who had been the first to leave the group, reappeared, and, accosting the singer —
            
            "My friend," said he, "my wife is ill, and your music will prevent her sleeping. If you have no particular reason for remaining here, go to the Place du Palais Eoyal, and here is a crown to indemnify you."
            
            "Thank you, my lord," replied the singer, measuring the social position of the giver by his generosity. "I will go directly. Have you any commissions for the Eue Mouffetard?"
            
            "No."
            
            "Because I would have executed them into the bargain. "
            
            The man went away, and, as he was at once the centre and the cause of the meeting, all that remained disappeared with him. At this moment the clock of the Palais Eoyal struck nine. The young man drew from his pocket a watch, whose diamond setting contrasted strangely with his simple costume. He set it exactly, then turned and went into the Eue des Bons Enfants. On arriving opposite No. 24, he found the coalheaver.

            "And the singer?" asked the latter.
            
            ' ' He is gone. ' '
            
            "Good."
            
            "And the post-chaise ?" asked the man in the cloak.
            
            "It is waiting at the corner of the Rue Baillif."
            
            "Have they taken the precaution of wrapping the wheels and horses' hoofs in rags ?"
            
            "Yes."
            
            "Very good. Now let us wait," said the man in the cloak.
            
            "Let us wait," replied the coalheaver. And all was silent.
            
            An hour passed, during which a few rare passers-by crossed the street at intervals, but at length it became almost deserted. The few lighted windows were darkened one after another, and night, having now nothing to contend with but the two lanterns, one of which was opposite the chapel of St. Clare, and the other at the corner of the Rue Baillif, at length reigned over the domain which it had alone claimed. Another hour passed. They heard the watch in the Rue de Valois; behind him, the keeper of the passage came to close the door.
            
            "Grood," murmured the man in the cloak; "now we are sure not to be interrupted. ' '
            
            "Provided," replied the coalheaver, "he leaves before day. ' '
            
            "If he were alone, we might fear his remaining; but Madame de Sabran will scarcely keep all three."
            
            "Pestef you are right, captain; and I had not thought of it; however, are all your precautions taken?" finished, nor the collection received. The crowd dispersed. A great many men left the circle, singly, or two and two, turning toward each other with an imperceptible gesture of the hand, some by the Kue de Yalois, some by the Cour des Fontaines, some by the Palais Eoyal itself, thus surrounding the Kue des Bons Enfants, which seemed to be the centre of the rendezvous.
